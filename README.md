# Pharma-Fetch-and-Analysis

One of the largest and fastest-growing industries in the world is the healthcare sector. The healthcare sector in India is predicted to grow at a CAGR of 16â€“17% over the next few
years, with a market value of about USD 280 billion. Some of the main factors driving this growth include the expanding prevalence of chronic diseases, rising disposable incomes,
and the rising demand for healthcare services.Customers now have a popular and convenient option to get healthcare products and services through online pharmacies and
healthcare platforms like 1mg. These platforms provide a wide selection of products at affordable costs, as well as the ease of home delivery and online consultations with medical
specialists.

The project was divided into 2 parts:
- PharmaFetch 
- PharmAnalysis 


## Pharm Fetch
The healthcare industry in India is rapidly growing. To meet the needs of customers, online pharmacies and healthcare platforms like 1mg have emerged, providing a wide
range of healthcare products and services at affordable costs, with the convenience of home delivery and online consultations with medical specialists. To gain insights into the
products offered by 1mg, their prices, we scraped data from the website using Beautiful Soup in Python, and stored it in a MongoDB database. Compilation constraints and timeconstraints have limited us to 500 medicines for each alphabet. For storing the data,
MongoDB was selected due to its flexibility and ability to handle unstructured data. 

## Pharm Analysis
With small pharmacies facing increased competition from multinational pharmacy chains and online pharmacy platforms, to remain competitive they need to be highly organized and use resources more
efficiently. To support this we have developed several Proof-of-Concept algorithms which would allow small pharmacies to improve inventory management and develop competent pricing strategies. These
algorithms have shown promising results and can be significantly improved upon with more resources. 
We are tackling 3 Objectives - 
- Build an algorithm which can classify medicines and other wellness products into categories by their manufacturer provided descriptions and details. We then aim to classify these medicines and
healthcare products according to the list of 40 general categories of medicines as listed by the FDA.
- Build a pricing model which would allow small pharmacies to accurately predict market prices of medicines and decide on a competitive selling point.
- Build an algorithm which can provide substitute recommendations for medicines based on their description and features, to enable better inventory organization.
